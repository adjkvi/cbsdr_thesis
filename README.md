## Abstract
In this thesis we investigate the effects on monetary policy of endogenizing the default rate on sovereign debt. We develop further the simple analytical model laid out in Bi, Leeper, and Leith (2018) in order to endogenize the default risk, by assuming it to be a non-linear function of the real debt servicing. This results in a model which, despite its simplicity, features a powerful feedback effect of monetary policy into the default risk of sovereign debt, as well as it incorporates an inflationary role of the sovereign debt stock. Effectively, a Fiscal Theory of Price Level type of model arises, which is however different from canonical FTPL models, since the role of sovereign debt in in determining inflation arises from the riskiness of sovereign debt itself. Insofar as the monetary authority targets the risky (government debt) rate, this will result in monetary policy being more accommodating and less capable of effectively bringing inflation to target. After having laid out the model, we consider different types of shocks and compare the monetary authority's response in different scenarios, the main findings being the following: first, confirming the results from Bi et al. (2018), if the targeted rate is the safe rate, the target inflation level can be always achieved, while this is not the case if the risky rate is considered; second, the endogeneity of the default risk results in larger and more persistent deviations of the key macroeconomic variables in response to shock.

## Content 
This repository displays the code for the Quantitative Analysis section of the thesis. The code is composed by two Dynare scripts, the .mod files, each containing the model and simulations for the two version of the model developed in the thesis, and of a Matlab script, used to execute the Dynare code as well as to plot the Impulse Response Functions of the simulations.
